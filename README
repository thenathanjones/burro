Why do this?
Why not?  Actually, it stemmed from the fact I wanted a .NET build monitor.  

Surely this exists?
If it does, Google is having trouble finding it at of the 18th of September 2011.  I've used Greenscreen (Ruby) and BigVisibleWall (Scala) but wanted a .NET version to tie in with the USB library I'd written (see nusb).

How do I use this?
I'll put some examples up as things progress, for now you'll just have to work it out yourself.
